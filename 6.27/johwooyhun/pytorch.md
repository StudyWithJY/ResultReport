    1. Load datasets and data.
    2. Data transforms.
    3. Image process.
    4. detect object and segement it.
In this code we'll use feature number 1 and 2.

## Run

Let's run some code.  
Since I'm studing so I'm gonna use tutorial code from [pytorch github](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/beginner_source/basics/quickstart_tutorial.py). Copy the code, and make a file named 'app.py' and paste it.  
And run following command in terminal.  
`python app.py`  
It will show this:
